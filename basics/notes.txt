Nodejs 
    A platform that allows us to run javascript on a computer/server
    read/delete/update files
    Easily communicate w/database
    Its very fast
    Huge ecosystem of open source packages
    Great for real-time services

How Javascript works?
    Computer doesnt understand js
    Js engine(v8) takes js and converts into machine code which is understandable by your machine
    Nodejs is written in C++


Event Emitter modules - events and util

Protocols: A set of rules that two sides agree used for communicating

Streams and Buffers

Buffers are small chunks of data that is being transferred from one place to another
Buffers are filled with data, then passed along
Transfer small chunks of data one at a time

Streams are Stream of data that flows overtime, from one place to another


Readable Stream: allow nodejs to read data from a Stream
Writable Stream: allow nodejs to write data to a Stream
Duplex: can read and write both to a Stream

Writable Streams

Pipes:
Read data using readStream and listened when we received the chunks of data and wrote the chunk of data in a file.
This process is done manually.

This can be done more elegantly using pipes.
Pipes can be used from only a Readable Stream, not from Writable Stream

Served HTML pages using readStream and created a server for this. Showed it in the browser
Served JSON Objects and one should always JSON.stringify(Objects) before sending the JSON Objects

Routing: set specific url and send them data(depends on what they request)
Node Package Manager: The Routing done in 'routing.js' is very cumbersome when it includes a large number of pages in our app.
    So, we use express package which slims this down.

    Basically a bunch of command line tools which helps us to install 3rd Party packages to help out in out node app projects.

    Express is such a package.

Package.json :  Information about the application
                Keeps track of our Dependencies/Packages we need to run the application
                We dont share the packages, we share the core development code, the packages will be downloaded in your local from package.json

- npm init -> Initializes your project with a package.json
