Buffers are small chunks of data that is being transferred from one place to another
Buffers are filled with data, then passed along
Transfer small chunks of data one at a time

Streams are Stream of data that flows overtime, from one place to another


Readable Stream: allow nodejs to read data from a Stream
Writable Stream: allow nodejs to write data to a Stream
Duplex: can read and write both to a StreamNodejs 
    A platform that allows us to run javascript on a computer/server
    read/delete/update files
    Easily communicate w/database
    Its very fast
    Huge ecosystem of open source packages
    Great for real-time services

How Javascript works?
    Computer doesnt understand js
    Js engine(v8) takes js and converts into machine code which is understandable by your machine
    Nodejs is written in C++
